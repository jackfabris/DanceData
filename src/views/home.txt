Ghillie Tracks 2.0 is an application designed to help teachers, class managers, and dancers in the Scottish Country Dance community research and manage dance and music resources.

Ghillie Tracks 2.0 has two main functions: 

[b]DanceData Search[/b] - Search a local version of the Scottish Country Dance database without being connected to the Internet, allowing access to the data from a laptop in a classroom environment. It also provides the capability of marking dances, publications, recordings, and albums as "I Have."

Every so often, users should update their copy of the database by pressing the "Update" button on the home screen. This will download the database from the [i]strathspey.org[/i] server. To perform a search, simply press the [i]Search[/i] button at the top of the application. You can then choose to search by dance, publication, recording, or album. Additionally, you can apply advanced search filters in order to find exactly what you're looking for. Hover over any of these additional search fields to see extra information about that filter. You can either press the search button or press enter to submit your query. Once the search has been performed, double click on any of the blue links in the results to see more information about it!

When viewing the results of a search or the info about any of the results, you can mark an item as "I Have" and add a tag to it. To save a tag, type it into the text field and press enter. When viewing information about an item, you may see an asterisk (*) next to some of the text. This means you have that item. For example, if you are looking at a publication and see some of its dances have an asterisk (*) after the name, then you have that dance in your collection.

* A note about using punctuation while searching: punctuation is included in the search string. If you search for "Mrs." it will only return items with "Mrs." in the name. Searching for "Mrs" will return everything that's either "Mrs" or "Mrs." Apostrophes are important too - "Threes" and "Three's" will return different results.

[b]Collections[/b] - View a list of dances, publications, recordings, and albums that you have marked as "I Have." You can also perform a search of your collection. This collection search functionality works the same way as the standard search, but is limited only to any items you have marked as "I Have."

To view your collection, press the [i]Collections[/i] button. You will see a list of any dances, publications, recordings, and albums that you have marked as "I Have." If you want to print a list of your albums or publications, simply click the "Export as PDF" button found at the bottom of the [i]Collections[/i] page.

* A note to users of the original Ghillie Tracks application: existing meta data files for "I Have" cannot be imported into this application. You will need to manually mark which items you have in your collection.
